# Setup Instructions

This repository contains multiple backend modules under `se-backend`.
Use the `setup_envs.sh` script to create a separate Python 3.12
virtual environment for each module. Requirements listed in each
module's `requirements.txt` will be installed automatically.

```bash
bash setup_envs.sh
```

The script assumes `python3.12` is available on your system.
